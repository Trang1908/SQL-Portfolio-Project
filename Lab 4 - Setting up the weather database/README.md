# Lab 4 - Weather Database Setup
In this lab, we will walk through the process of setting up the weather database. This process involves:

## Datasets: 
We will be utilising three datasets - 'cat_locations.sql', 'metoffice_dailyweatherdata.sql', and 'weatherType'.

## SQL Code File: 
You can locate the necessary SQL code in the file named 'SQL Code - Setting up the Weather Database (Lab 4)'.

During this lab, you will gain knowledge about using conditional statements, searching for specified patterns in columns, as well as creating and dropping views.

# Lab 5 - Weather Database Setup
In this lab, we will go through the process of setting up the weather database. This includes:

## Datasets:
We will be utilising five different datasets - 'metoffice_dailyweatherdata.sql', 'metoffice_forecast_text.sql', 'timezone.sql', 'zones.sql', and 'cat_locations.sql'.

## SQL Code File:
It can be found in the file named  'SQL Code - Setting up the Weather Database (Lab 5)'.

During this lab, you will gain knowledge about using arithmetic operators, logical operators, comparison operators, regular expressions, subqueries in the SELECT statement, subqueries in the FROM statement, and subqueries in the WHERE statement.

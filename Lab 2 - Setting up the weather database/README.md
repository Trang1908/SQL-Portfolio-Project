# Lab 2 - Weather Database Setup

In this lab, we will go through the process of setting up the weather database. This includes:

Datasets: We will be utilising two datasets - 'cat_locations.sql' and 'metoffice_dailyweatherdata.sql'.
SQL Code File: You can find it in the file named 'SQL Code - Setting up the weather database (Lab 2)'.

During this lab, we will gain knowledge about querying data and filtering rows with conditions within a subset using the WHERE IN statement. Additionally, we will explore handling NULL fields, sorting data using ORDER, and performing aggregations.

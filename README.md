# SQL-Portfolio-Project
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Repository!
This Repository contains a collection of small SQL projects that I have worked on during my time at university. 
These projects showcase my skills and experience with SQL, covering a variety of data manipulation and database management tasks.


# Projects included
1. Data cleaning with "Nashville Housing data".
2. Create a table named "client_data" and perform some basic schema operations, including INSERT, ALTER, UPDATE, and DROP.
3. Lab 1 - Setting up the weather database.

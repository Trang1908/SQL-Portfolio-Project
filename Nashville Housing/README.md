# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

In this exercise, we will practice data cleaning using the 'Nashville Housing Data.xlsx' dataset. 

The SQL code file can be found as 'NashVilleHousing.sql' including tasks such as reformatting of sale dates, 
eliminating duplicate records, performing joins, and splitting address data into distinct columns.
